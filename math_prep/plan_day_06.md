Day 6: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Focus: Today you will tackle exponentials and logarithms in depth. These functions feature prominently in Calculus (for example, $e^x$ is its own derivative, and log functions often appear in integration results). A solid handle on their properties and algebra is essential. Calculus II especially involves exponential growth/decay models and logarithmic integrals, so we must not skip these core concepts ￼.
	•	Topics to Master:
	•	Exponential Functions: Understand $a^x$ for various bases $a$. Special focus on base $e$ (the natural exponential, $e \approx 2.71828$) since $e^x$ is ubiquitous in calculus. Know the general shape of $y = a^x$ (always positive, growth if $a>1$, decay if $0<a<1$). Properties to know: $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$, $a^{-k} = \frac{1}{a^k}$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$. Practice simplifying expressions with exponents, including those with different bases (e.g., compare growth of $2^x$ vs $3^x$).
	•	Logarithmic Functions: Understand that $\log_a x$ is the inverse of $a^x$. In particular, the natural logarithm $\ln x$ is the inverse of $e^x$. Learn basic log properties: $\log(ab) = \log a + \log b$, $\log(\frac{a}{b}) = \log a - \log b$, $\log(a^r) = r \log a$. Also, remember $\ln(e^x) = x$ and $e^{\ln x} = x$. Practice converting between exponential and log form: e.g. $a^b = c$ is equivalent to $\log_a c = b$.
	•	Laws of Exponents and Logs: Work through examples using the laws. For instance: simplify $5e^3 \cdot 2e^{-1}$, or solve $3^{x} = 17$ by taking logs. Also practice expanding/condensing logs: e.g. write $\ln\left(\frac{x^5 \sqrt{y}}{z^2}\right)$ as a sum/difference $5\ln x + \frac{1}{2}\ln y - 2\ln z$. These manipulations come in handy when integrating or differentiating log expressions.
	•	Solving Equations Involving Exponentials/Logs: Try solving equations like $2^{x} = 7$ (take log base 2 or use natural log: $x = \ln 7 / \ln 2$) and log equations like $\log_3 (x) = 4$ ($x = 3^4 = 81$). Also combined types: $e^{2x} = 5$ (so $2x = \ln 5$, $x = \frac{1}{2}\ln 5$), or $\ln(2x - 1) = 3$ (so $2x - 1 = e^3$, etc.). These skills are directly used when solving for time in growth/decay models or finding when an exponential function reaches a certain value.
	•	Applications Insight (Optional): Understand conceptually what $e^x$ and $\ln x$ mean: $e^x$ arises in continuously compounded growth (Calc II will likely cover $e^x$ in integrals and series), and $\ln x$ is the area under $1/t$ from 1 to $x$ (an idea from calculus). While deep understanding isn’t needed yet, it’s good to know these connections exist.
	•	Learning Resources:
	•	Khan Academy – Exponentials & Logarithms: Use the “Exponential growth & decay” and “Intro to logarithms” modules. Khan has targeted exercises for converting forms, using log properties, and solving equations (like solving $10^{3x}=7$). Be sure to do the quizzes on those topics to test your fluency.
	•	Paul’s Online Math Notes – Algebra Review: Exponentials and Logarithms: Paul’s review sections on Basic Exponential Functions and Basic Logarithm Functions will reinforce definitions and properties ￼. He also covers Log Properties and solving equations in subsequent sub-sections. These notes concisely list out laws of logs and have example problems; use them to double-check your understanding. Paul notes that the ability to manipulate exponents and logs is assumed going into calculus, so make sure you’re comfortable.
	•	Purplemath – Logarithms: Purplemath’s logarithm tutorials￼ are excellent at explaining the “why” behind log rules and giving step-by-step examples of solving log equations and simplifying expressions. If logs are new or rusty for you, spend time with these explanations.
	•	Interactive Visualization: Check out Desmos or another graphing tool to plot $y = 2^x$, $y = 3^x$, and $y = e^x$ on the same axes, as well as $y = \ln x$. Visually see how $\ln x$ is the mirror image of $e^x$ across the line $y=x$. This will help you remember their inverse relationship.
	•	Practice:
	•	Write out the three most important log identities and exponent rules from memory, then verify them. For example, test that $\ln(ab) = \ln a + \ln b$ by picking numbers (like $a=2,b=5$, check $\ln(10)$ vs $\ln2+\ln5$ on a calculator). Do this to cement the properties in your mind.
	•	Simplify expressions: e.g. $3^{2x} \cdot 3^{-x} = 3^x$, or $\frac{e^{4x}}{e^{x}} = e^{3x}$. Also $\log_{5}(25x) = \log_{5}25 + \log_{5}x = 2 + \log_{5}x$.
	•	Solve 5 exponent equations and 5 log equations:
	•	Exponential: $4^{x}=50$; $e^{x}-5=0$; $10 \cdot 2^{3x} = 160$; $5^{2x+1}=125$; $e^{-x} = 7$.
	•	Log: $\ln x = 2$; $\log_{3}(x) = -1$; $\ln(2x) = 4$; $\log_{10}(x+1) = 2$; $3 + \ln x = 5$.
	•	For each, isolate $x$ and express the answer either exactly (like $x = \ln(7)$ or $x = 2^{\log_2 50}$, etc.) or a decimal if needed. Make sure you know how to handle when you take log of both sides vs exponentiating both sides.
	•	Combine and break down logs: take something like $\frac{\ln(a^3 \sqrt{b})}{\ln(a \cdot b)}$ and simplify it using properties (just for manipulation practice).
	•	By the end of practice, manipulating and solving exponentials/logs should feel routine. If it’s not yet, do a few more practice problems – these are that important to get right before calculus.

Why this matters: In Calculus II, you will frequently encounter $e^x$ and $\ln x$. For instance, when integrating $\frac{1}{x}$, you’ll get $\ln|x| + C$. Solving growth/decay problems involves $e^{kt}$ forms. Improper integrals often use $\ln$. If you’re fluent in exponent and log rules, you can seamlessly follow the calculus logic without tripping over algebra. Also, series expansions (a Calc II topic) for $e^x$ and $\ln(1+x)$ are common – understanding the behavior of these functions now will give context to those series later. Essentially, exponentials and logs are so fundamental that a calculus student must be comfortable with them, as they are standard examples and solutions in many problems ￼. Get to the point where seeing $e^x$ or $\ln x$ in a problem feels familiar and not intimidating.
