## ✅ Day 8 Mastery Criteria

You are finished with **Day 8** when:
- Distance and midpoint formulas are instinctive
- You can identify conic sections by equation structure
- Symmetry is recognized immediately
- Polar coordinates feel interpretable, not foreign
- Parametric equations feel like alternate descriptions, not new math

This day removes the final geometric friction before advanced calculus topics.
