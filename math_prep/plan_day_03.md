Day 3: Polynomials, Factoring, and Quadratic Equations

Focus: Today is about polynomials – algebraic expressions that appear everywhere in calculus. You’ll learn how to manipulate polynomials, factor them (a crucial skill), and solve quadratic equations. This is the heart of algebra preparation for calculus: without comfort here, calculus will be a struggle ￼.
	•	Topics to Master:
	•	Polynomial Operations: Understand what polynomials are (expressions like $2x^3 - 5x + 7$) and practice adding, subtracting, and multiplying them. For example, be able to expand $(x + 2)(x - 3)$ and add/subtract polynomials of like degree. (Division of polynomials is less critical at this moment, except as needed for factoring/partial fractions.)
	•	Factoring Techniques: This is critical. Learn to factor:
	•	Greatest Common Factor (GCF): e.g. factor $6x^2 - 8x = 2x(3x - 4)$.
	•	Trinomials ($ax^2 + bx + c$): e.g. $x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x+2)(x+3)$. Start with simple $x^2$ cases, then try those with a leading coefficient ($2x^2 + 7x + 3$, etc.).
	•	Difference of Squares: e.g. $9y^2 - 16 = (3y - 4)(3y + 4)$.
	•	Recognize prime polynomials (not factorable over reals) vs those that factor nicely. Factoring is so important that it will appear in almost every chapter of calculus – it’s vital to master it ￼.
	•	Solving Quadratic Equations: Combine your factoring skills with equation-solving. Solve quadratics by factoring when possible (set each factor to zero). Also, know the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ for equations that don’t factor nicely. Practice a few examples of each.
	•	Solve something like $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$ by factoring $(x+3)(x-2)=0$ so $x=-3,2$.
	•	Solve something like $3x^2 - x - 4 = 0$ using the formula (since it may not factor easily).
	•	Quadratic Applications: (Optional) Try one real-world style problem, e.g., finding two numbers that multiply to a certain product and add to a certain sum – these often lead to quadratic equations. This helps reinforce understanding of what the factors mean.
	•	Learning Resources:
	•	Paul’s Online Math Notes – Factoring Polynomials: Paul’s notes emphasize that factoring “will appear in pretty much every chapter… and so is vital that you understand it” ￼. Read through his overview of factoring techniques. Pay attention to each type (GCF, trinomials, etc.) and the provided examples.
	•	Khan Academy – Polynomial Arithmetic and Factoring: Use Khan Academy’s sequences on “Multiplying polynomials” and “Factor polynomials”. The videos there walk through examples step-by-step. Do the exercises, especially factoring practice – Khan will give immediate feedback if you misfactor, which is helpful.
	•	Video Resource (Optional): The Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube has an excellent Algebra video on factoring and quadratic equations￼ (covering multiple examples in a clear way). Watching a few worked examples can solidify the patterns.
	•	Practice: Spend ample time on practice problems:
	•	Write down 5 polynomials and factor each (e.g. factor $4x^2 - 12x$, $t^2 - 9$, $m^2 + 4m + 3$, $2y^2 + y - 1$). Check your answers against solutions (from a textbook or online factoring calculator) to ensure you factored correctly.
	•	Solve ~5 quadratic equations: a mix of easy factoring (as in the examples above) and ones requiring the quadratic formula.
	•	Also try one that has no real solution (discriminant $<0$) so you recognize when a quadratic has no real roots (this can matter in calculus when finding domain or critical points).
	•	Remember to revisit any factoring pattern that feels tricky; factoring is so important going forward that investing extra time here will pay off tremendously.

Why this matters: Factoring and polynomial skills are the backbone of many calculus techniques. For instance, simplifying a complex fraction in a limit or performing partial fraction decomposition in an integral both require strong factoring ability. As Paul’s notes warn, factoring shows up over and over ￼. Also, solving quadratic equations is necessary for finding points of interest on functions (e.g. where a derivative equals zero, which often leads to a quadratic). After today, you should be able to factor and solve quadratics almost on autopilot – freeing your mental energy for the new concepts introduced in calculus.
