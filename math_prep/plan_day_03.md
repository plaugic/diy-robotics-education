## Day 3: Polynomials, Factoring, and Quadratic Equations

### Focus
Today is about **polynomials**—algebraic expressions that appear everywhere in calculus. You’ll learn how to manipulate polynomials, factor them (a crucial skill), and solve quadratic equations. This is the heart of algebra preparation for calculus: without comfort here, calculus will be a struggle.

### Topics to Master

#### 1. Polynomial Operations
Understand what polynomials are (expressions like  
\[
2x^3 - 5x + 7
\]
) and practice:
- Adding and subtracting polynomials
- Multiplying polynomials  

Be able to expand expressions such as:
\[
(x + 2)(x - 3)
\]

Also practice adding/subtracting polynomials of like degree.  
> *Note:* Division of polynomials is less critical at this moment, except as needed for factoring or partial fractions later.

#### 2. Factoring Techniques (**Critical**)
Factoring is one of the most important algebra skills for calculus. Learn to factor:

- **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**  
  Example:
  \[
  6x^2 - 8x = 2x(3x - 4)
  \]

- **Trinomials (\(ax^2 + bx + c\))**  
  Example:
  \[
  x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
  \]  
  Start with simple \(x^2\) cases, then move to trinomials with a leading coefficient, such as:
  \[
  2x^2 + 7x + 3
  \]

- **Difference of Squares**  
  Example:
  \[
  9y^2 - 16 = (3y - 4)(3y + 4)
  \]

- **Recognizing Prime Polynomials**  
  Learn to distinguish polynomials that factor over the reals from those that do not.

> Factoring appears in almost every chapter of calculus, so it is vital to master it.

#### 3. Solving Quadratic Equations
Combine factoring skills with equation-solving techniques.

- **Solve by factoring** (when possible):  
  Example:
  \[
  x^2 + x - 6 = 0
  \]  
  Factor:
  \[
  (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0
  \]  
  Solutions:
  \[
  x = -3,\; 2
  \]

- **Quadratic Formula** (when factoring is difficult):  
  \[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  \]  
  Example:
  \[
  3x^2 - x - 4 = 0
  \]

Practice several examples of both approaches.

---

#### 4. Quadratic Applications (Optional)
Try one real-world–style problem, such as:
- Finding two numbers that multiply to a given product and add to a given sum

These problems often lead to quadratic equations and help reinforce the meaning of factors.

### Learning Resources

- **Paul’s Online Math Notes – Factoring Polynomials**  
  These notes emphasize that factoring “will appear in pretty much every chapter… and so is vital that you understand it.” Review each factoring type (GCF, trinomials, difference of squares, etc.) and study the examples carefully.

- **Khan Academy – Polynomial Arithmetic and Factoring**  
  Work through:
  - *Multiplying polynomials*
  - *Factor polynomials*  
  Complete the exercises—immediate feedback is especially helpful for correcting factoring mistakes.

- **Video Resource (Optional)**  
  *The Organic Chemistry Tutor* on YouTube has clear, example-heavy videos on factoring and solving quadratic equations that can help solidify patterns.

### Practice

- **Factoring Practice**  
  Factor at least 5 polynomials, such as:
  - \(4x^2 - 12x\)
  - \(t^2 - 9\)
  - \(m^2 + 4m + 3\)
  - \(2y^2 + y - 1\)

  Check your answers using a textbook or an online factoring calculator.

- **Quadratic Equations**  
  Solve ~5 quadratic equations:
  - Some that factor easily
  - Some that require the quadratic formula

- **No Real Solutions**  
  Solve at least one quadratic with a negative discriminant (\(< 0\)) so you can recognize when a quadratic has no real roots—important later for domain and critical point analysis in calculus.

> Revisit any factoring pattern that feels tricky. Extra time spent here will pay off tremendously.

### Why This Matters
Factoring and polynomial skills are the backbone of many calculus techniques. Examples include:
- Simplifying complex fractions in limits
- Partial fraction decomposition in integrals
- Solving equations to find critical points (where derivatives equal zero)

Factoring shows up repeatedly, and solving quadratic equations is essential for analyzing functions. By the end of today, you should be able to factor and solve quadratics almost on autopilot—freeing your mental energy for new calculus concepts.
