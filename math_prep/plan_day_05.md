## Day 5: Understanding Functions and Graphs

### Focus
With algebraic techniques in hand, turn to the concept of a **function** — the cornerstone of calculus. A strong intuitive grasp of functions (what they mean, how to interpret their graphs, domain/range, etc.) is essential for understanding limits, derivatives, and integrals.

Today you will learn function notation, analyze basic graphs, and practice manipulating functions.

## Topics to Master

### Function Definition and Notation
- Understand a function as a rule that assigns **each input exactly one output**.
- Learn notation like `f(x)` and the idea that `y = f(x)`.
- Be comfortable interpreting statements like:
  - For `f(x) = x² − 3`, then `f(2) = 1`.
- You should be able to define and work with functions fluidly.

---

### Domain and Range
- **Domain**: all allowable `x` inputs.
- **Range**: all possible `y` outputs.
- Example:
  - `g(x) = √(x − 1)`
    - Domain: `x ≥ 1`
    - Range: `g(x) ≥ 0`
- Practice finding domains for:
  - Rational functions (denominators ≠ 0)
  - Even roots (radicand ≥ 0)
- This skill becomes important when dealing with **integrals and series convergence** in Calculus II.

### Basic Types of Functions and Their Graphs
Ensure you recognize and can roughly sketch the following:

- **Linear functions**
  - Graphs are lines
  - Slope–intercept form: `y = mx + b`
  - Know slope, x-intercept, and y-intercept

- **Quadratic functions**
  - `y = ax² + bx + c` (parabolas)
  - Identify vertex form if possible
  - Know whether it opens up or down

- **Polynomial functions**
  - Understand general shapes and end behavior
  - Focus mainly on quadratics for now

- **Rational functions**
  - `y = 1/x`: vertical and horizontal asymptotes, two branches
  - `y = (ax + b)/(cx + d)` basic hyperbolas

- **Exponential and logarithmic functions**
  - `y = aˣ`: grows rapidly
  - `y = logₐ(x)`: grows slowly, inverse of exponential  
  *(We’ll focus more on these in Day 6)*

- **Trigonometric functions**
  - Sine, cosine, etc. *(covered Day 7)*
  - Optional preview: `y = sin x`, `y = cos x` oscillate

- **Absolute value and piecewise functions**
  - `y = |x|`: V-shape graph
  - Piecewise-defined functions
  - Common in continuity and integrals

---

### Graphical Features
Practice reading graphs and identifying:
- Intercepts
- Increasing vs. decreasing intervals
- Symmetry
  - **Even functions**: `f(−x) = f(x)` (y-axis symmetry), e.g. `x²`
  - **Odd functions**: `f(−x) = −f(x)` (origin symmetry), e.g. `x³`, `sin x`

Understanding symmetry can simplify many problems.

---

### Function Operations
If time allows, cover:

- **Function addition**
  - `(f + g)(x)`
- **Composition**
  - `(f ∘ g)(x)`
  - Example:
    - `f(u) = √u`, `g(x) = x² + 1`
    - `f(g(x)) = √(x² + 1)`
- **Inverses**
  - Example:
    - `f(x) = 3x − 5`
    - `f⁻¹(x) = (x + 5) / 3`

These appear in calculus during substitution and solving for variables.

## Practice

### Evaluate Functions
- If `f(x) = x² − 2x`:
  - Find `f(0)`
  - Find `f(3)`
  - Solve `f(x) = 2`
- Given a piecewise function:
  - `h(x) = { x² if x < 0 ; 2x + 1 if x ≥ 0 }`
  - Evaluate values and understand graph behavior

---

### Domain and Range
Determine domain and range of:
- (a) `f(x) = (x + 2)/(x − 1)`
- (b) `g(x) = √(4 − x²)`
- (c) `h(x) = ln(x − 5)`  
  - Domain: `x > 5`

Example:
- For `g(x) = √(4 − x²)`:
  - Domain: `−2 ≤ x ≤ 2`
  - Range: `0 ≤ g(x) ≤ 2`

- `y = x³` (odd symmetry)
- `y = |x|`
- `y = 1/x` (two branches)
- `y = √x`

Mark intercepts and asymptotes.

  - Find `(f ∘ g)(2)`
  - Simplify `f(g(x))`

## Why This Matters
Calculus is the study of **how functions behave** — how they change and accumulate.

To understand:
- Limits of `f(x)`
- Slopes of `y = f(x)`
- Continuity, derivatives, and integrals

…you must be fluent in the language of functions and graphs.

Many Calculus II topics (power series, rational integrals, asymptotic behavior) rely on:
- Domains
- Graph behavior
- Restrictions

**Functions are the canvas on which calculus is painted.**  
Master them now, and everything that follows will be far easier to understand.
