Day 5: Understanding Functions and Graphs

Focus: With algebraic techniques in hand, turn to the concept of a function – the cornerstone of calculus. A strong intuitive grasp of functions (what they mean, how to interpret their graphs, domain/range, etc.) is essential for understanding limits, derivatives, and integrals. Today you will learn function notation, analyze basic graphs, and practice manipulating functions.
	•	Topics to Master:
	•	Function Definition and Notation: Understand a function as a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. Learn notation like $f(x)$ and the idea that $y = f(x)$. Be comfortable interpreting statements like “for $f(x) = x^2 - 3$, $f(2) = 1$”. You should be able to define and work with functions fluidly ￼.
	•	Domain and Range: Given a function formula, determine its domain (all allowable $x$ inputs) and range (possible $y$ outputs). For instance, for $g(x) = \sqrt{x-1}$, domain is $x \ge 1$ and range is $g(x) \ge 0$. Practice finding domain for functions involving fractions (denominators $\neq 0$) or evens roots (radicand $\ge 0$). This skill becomes important when dealing with integrals and series convergence in Calc II.
	•	Basic Types of Functions and Their Graphs: Ensure you recognize and can roughly sketch the following:
	•	Linear functions (graphs are lines, slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$). Know how slope works and how to find x- and y-intercepts.
	•	Quadratic functions ($y = ax^2 + bx + c$ parabolas). Identify vertex form if possible, and know if it opens up/down.
	•	Polynomial functions more generally (shapes, end-behavior for leading term – though you needn’t get too detailed beyond quadratics for now).
	•	Rational functions like $y = \frac{1}{x}$ (know it has vertical/horizontal asymptotes and two branch graphs). Also $y = \frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$ basic hyperbolas.
	•	Exponential ($y = a^x$) and Logarithmic ($y = \log_a x$) – we’ll focus more on these Day 6, but be aware of their general shapes (exponential grows rapidly, log grows slowly and is inverse of exponential).
	•	Trigonometric (sine, cosine etc.) – to be covered Day 7, but if you have time you might glance at how $y=\sin x$ and $y=\cos x$ oscillate.
	•	Absolute value ($y = |x|$ V-shape graph) and piecewise functions (defined by different formulas on different intervals). These often appear in calculus for continuity and integrals.
	•	Graphical Features: Practice reading a graph: given a function graph, identify key features like intercepts, where it’s increasing or decreasing, any symmetry (even/odd functions), etc. For example, know that an even function satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ (graph is y-axis symmetric) – e.g. $x^2$ – and an odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ (origin symmetric) – e.g. $x^3$ or $\sin x$ ￼. Understanding symmetry can simplify problems.
	•	Function Operations: If time, cover combining functions: $(f+g)(x)$, $(f\circ g)(x)$ (composition). Composition is particularly important – e.g. if $f(u) = \sqrt{u}$ and $u = g(x) = x^2+1$, then $f(g(x)) = \sqrt{x^2+1}$. Practice a couple of compositions and simple inverses (e.g. $f(x)=3x-5$, then $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x+5}{3}$). These come up in calculus when you do substitution or invert functions to solve for $x$.
	•	Learning Resources:
	•	Khan Academy – Functions and Graphs: Go through the “Functions” unit on Khan Academy. Key subtopics include function notation, domain and range, and recognizing function types. Khan’s interactive questions will test if you can evaluate functions (like find $h(2)$ given a graph or formula) and determine domains.
	•	Paul’s Online Math Notes – Algebra/Trig Review: Functions and Graphing: Paul includes a section on function notation/evaluation and one on common graphs ￼. Review the list of “common functions and how to graph them” ￼ – this covers lines, parabolas, circles, etc. (Note: Conic sections like circles, ellipses, hyperbolas are listed; while you don’t need detailed conic knowledge for Calc II, it’s good to recognize their equations. Circles and hyperbolas may appear in some integrals or parametric form, but you won’t delve deeply into conics in calculus.) Pay attention to the concept of piecewise definitions in these notes too.
	•	Desmos Graphing Calculator (Interactive): Use the free Desmos online graphing tool ￼. It’s a fantastic way to visualize functions. Try plotting basic functions: input y = 2x + 1, y = x^2 - 4, y = 1/x, y = 2^x, etc., and observe their shapes. Utilize sliders (Desmos allows you to add sliders for parameters) – for example, graph $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ with sliders for $a, b, c$ to see how the parabola changes. This visual exploration helps cement your understanding of how algebraic changes affect graphs.
	•	Math Is Fun – Function Introduction: If you prefer a gentle introduction, the MathIsFun function guide￼ explains functions in simple terms with diagrams, covering the idea of inputs/outputs, domains, etc.
	•	Practice:
	•	Evaluate functions: If $f(x) = x^2 - 2x$, find $f(0)$, $f(3)$, solve $f(x)=2$ for $x$. Given a piecewise function (like $h(x) = {x^2 \text{ if } x<0; ; 2x+1 \text{ if } x\ge0}$), practice finding a couple of values and understanding the graph’s split behavior.
	•	Domain/range: Determine the domain of: (a) $f(x) = \frac{x+2}{x-1}$, (b) $g(x) = \sqrt{4-x^2}$, (c) $h(x) = \ln(x-5)$ (logarithm, domain $x>5$). For each, describe the range too (e.g. for $g(x)=\sqrt{4-x^2}$, domain $-2\le x \le 2$, range $0 \le g(x) \le 2$).
	•	Sketch by hand (roughly) a few basic functions without plotting software, to ensure you know their general shape: try to draw $y = x^3$ (and note it’s odd-symmetric), $y = |x|$, $y = 1/x$ (two branches), $y = \sqrt{x}$. Mark key points like intercepts and asymptotes.
	•	If you learned composition: let $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = 3x-1$. Find $(f \circ g)(2)$ and simplify the formula for $f(g(x))$. Also find an $f^{-1}(x)$ for a simple $f$ if you tried inverses.
	•	Being comfortable with these will make a big difference as we enter calculus concepts (since we’ll talk about continuous functions, increasing/decreasing behavior, etc., all in terms of functions and their graphs).

Why this matters: Calculus is essentially the study of how functions behave (how they change, accumulate, etc.). You need to “speak the language” of functions. When a problem asks for the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches some value, or the slope of the graph of $y = f(x)$, you must be comfortable understanding $f$ and its graph. Also, some Calculus II topics (like finding the radius of convergence of a power series, or integrating a rational function) require knowing the domain of a function or asymptotic behavior, which ties back to function graphs and restrictions. By mastering functions now, you’ll have a much easier time understanding the formal definitions (like continuity and limits) that are coming up next. Essentially, functions are the canvas on which calculus is painted, so ensure you have a clear picture of that canvas.
