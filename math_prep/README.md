# 10-Day Calc II Prerequisite Coverage Plan

**(Every Concept Explicitly Mapped · Zero Gaps · Zero Assumptions)**

> **Time Assumption:** 6–8 focused hours per day  
> **Design Rule:** If a concept appears anywhere in the prerequisite hierarchy, it is **explicitly covered in a day plan**.  
> **Philosophy:** Coverage > elegance. Recognition > memorization.

This repository is designed to remove *all* ambiguity about Calc II readiness.

Each day has its own detailed plan located in the `math_prep/` directory:
- **Day 1:** [plan_day_01.md](plan_day_01.md)
- **Day 2:** [plan_day_02.md](plan_day_02.md)
- **Day 3:** [plan_day_03.md](plan_day_03.md)
- **Day 4:** [plan_day_04.md](plan_day_04.md)
- **Day 5:** [plan_day_05.md](plan_day_05.md)
- **Day 6:** [plan_day_06.md](plan_day_06.md)
- **Day 7:** [plan_day_07.md](plan_day_07.md)
- **Day 8:** [plan_day_08.md](plan_day_08.md)
- **Day 9:** [plan_day_09.md](plan_day_09.md)
- **Day 10:** [plan_day_10.md](plan_day_10.md)

## Suggested Usage Pattern

- Read the day plan top-to-bottom once
- Then study **by section**, not by time
- Stop when mastery criteria are met
- Move forward only when recognition feels automatic

This is not a “study guide.”  
It is a **coverage guarantee**.
