# 10-Day Math Self-Study Crash Course  
## From Basics to Calculus II Readiness

---

## Overview

Preparing for **Calculus II in just 10 days** is an intensive but achievable challenge. This plan focuses on **essential topics only**—arithmetic, algebra, functions, trigonometry, and the core concepts of **Calculus I**—because a solid grasp of these areas is absolutely critical before tackling Calculus II.

Standard calculus prerequisites include a firm command of **algebra, trigonometry, and logarithms**. Each day in this plan builds upon prior material in a **logical progression**, ensuring that foundational skills are reinforced as you advance.

By the end of **Day 10**, you should feel confident in:
- Manipulating algebraic expressions  
- Understanding and working with functions  
- Applying core trigonometric concepts  
- Grasping the essential ideas of limits, derivatives, and integrals  

These are the skills you *must* internalize before moving on to Calculus II.

## How to Use This Plan

- Dedicate **several hours each day** to learning and practice.
- Each day outlines:
  - **Topics to Master**
  - **Suggested Learning Resources** (videos, articles, interactive tools)
- **Practice problems are non-negotiable.** Solving problems is the only way to solidify understanding.
- Skim or skip material you’re already comfortable with, **but do not skip core concepts**.
- If the pace feels too fast:
  - Slow down
  - Add more practice
  - Supplement with additional explanations  
  Moving forward with shaky understanding will hurt you later.

This is a *skills bootcamp*, not passive reading.

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

Each day has its own detailed plan located in the `math_prep/` directory:

- **Day 1:** [plan_day_01.md](plan_day_01.md)
- **Day 2:** [plan_day_02.md](plan_day_02.md)
- **Day 3:** [plan_day_03.md](plan_day_03.md)
- **Day 4:** [plan_day_04.md](plan_day_04.md)
- **Day 5:** [plan_day_05.md](plan_day_05.md)
- **Day 6:** [plan_day_06.md](plan_day_06.md)
- **Day 7:** [plan_day_07.md](plan_day_07.md)
- **Day 8:** [plan_day_08.md](plan_day_08.md)
- **Day 9:** [plan_day_09.md](plan_day_09.md)
- **Day 10:** [plan_day_10.md](plan_day_10.md)

Follow the sequence. Each day assumes mastery (or active reinforcement) of the previous day’s material.

## Final Notes

Practice is the key to success.

Even after completing this 10-day sprint, **continue solving problems**. Calculus is not a spectator sport—the more you *do*, the more you internalize.

By completing this plan, you will have built a strong foundation spanning:
- Arithmetic
- Algebra
- Functions
- Trigonometry
- Core Calculus I concepts

With focus and continued practice, you will be **well-prepared to succeed in Calculus II**.

Good luck—and enjoy the journey into higher mathematics.
