# Day 9 — Limits & Continuity

**Goal:** Build a complete conceptual and procedural foundation for limits and continuity so derivatives and integrals feel logically inevitable rather than mysterious.

**Scope:** Covers **all limit foundations**  
**Time Expectation:** 6–8 focused hours  
**Rule:** A limit describes *behavior*, not necessarily value.

- One-sided limits feel intuitive
- You choose the correct limit technique instinctively
- Continuity conditions are recalled without effort
- Special limits are memorized with understanding

This day is the conceptual bridge into derivatives and integrals.
