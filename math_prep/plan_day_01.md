Day 1: Arithmetic and Fundamental Algebraic Operations

Focus: Refresh the building blocks of mathematics – these underpin all later topics. You’ll need to be fluent with numerical operations and basic algebraic notation to succeed in higher math.
	•	Topics to Master:
	•	Fractions and Decimals: Converting between them, and performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of each. Ensure you can find common denominators and understand place values for decimals.
	•	Percentages: Converting to/from decimals and fractions, and solving simple percentage problems (e.g. find 20% of 60).
	•	Negative Numbers and Absolute Value: Adding/subtracting negatives, understanding the number line; the meaning of absolute value as a distance from zero.
	•	Order of Operations (PEMDAS): Evaluate expressions like –$2^2 + (3\ –\ 5)$ correctly by following the conventional order.
	•	Basic Variable Notation: What a variable is (e.g. $x$ in an expression), and substituting values into simple expressions.
	•	Learning Resources:
	•	Khan Academy – Arithmetic (videos and exercises): Covers all core arithmetic skills, from fractions and decimals to negative numbers (ideal for a quick refresher) ￼. Work through the “Fractions, decimals, & percentages” unit to ensure you’re comfortable with these conversions and operations.
	•	Purplemath – Fractions and Absolute Value (online lessons): Read Purplemath’s tutorials on fractions￼ for tips on common pitfalls (like when to find a common denominator) and on absolute value￼ to reinforce your understanding of positives/negatives.
	•	Practice: After reviewing, solidify skills by doing practice problems. Khan Academy’s Arithmetic practice sets are very effective – for example, try exercises on adding fractions and on negative number operations. Aim to comfortably handle problems like: Compute $ \frac{3}{4} + \frac{2}{3} $; Convert 0.375 to a fraction; Evaluate $|,5 - 8,|$.

Why this matters: Calculus manipulations often boil down to algebraic and numeric steps. If you can’t confidently handle fractions or negatives, even a simple calculus problem can trip you up. So invest time here to eliminate small algebra mistakes later ￼. Mastery of Day 1 material means you can swiftly perform calculations and move on to higher concepts without stumbling over arithmetic.
