## ✅ Day 1 Mastery Criteria

You are finished with **Day 1** when:
- Fractions and decimals cause zero hesitation  
- Negative numbers feel intuitive  
- Absolute value is reflexive  
- PEMDAS is automatic  
- Substitution feels trivial and boring  

If any of these feel slow, repeat the relevant section before moving on.
