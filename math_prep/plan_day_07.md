# Day 7 — Trigonometry

**Goal:** Achieve full operational fluency in trigonometry so identities, equations, and trig-based calculus techniques feel natural rather than memorized.

**Scope:** Covers **all Trigonometry Prerequisites**  
**Time Expectation:** 6–8 focused hours  
**Rule:** Trigonometry is *pattern recognition*, not computation. Memorize structure, not steps.
