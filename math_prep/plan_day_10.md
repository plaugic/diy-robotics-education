# Day 10 — Derivatives, Sequences & Series Foundations

**Goal:** Finish all remaining Calculus I foundations and gain controlled exposure to Calculus II concepts so the transition feels familiar rather than abrupt.

**Scope:** Covers **remaining Calc I + Calc II pre-exposure**  
**Time Expectation:** 6–8 focused hours  
**Rule:** Today is about *recognition*, not mastery. You are building mental templates.
