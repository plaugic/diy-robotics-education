Day 10: Integration – Antiderivatives and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Focus: In the final stretch, you’ll tackle the basics of integration, which is the other fundamental operation in calculus (roughly the inverse of differentiation). Calculus II will delve deep into integration techniques and applications, so today we establish a strong base: understanding integrals as antiderivatives and area, learning to compute basic integrals, and appreciating the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) which links derivatives and integrals. By the end, you should be able to integrate standard functions and know how integration will expand in Calc II.
	•	Topics to Master:
	•	Antiderivatives: Recognize that integration (indefinite integrals) is about finding a function $F(x)$ whose derivative is the given function $f(x)$. For example, an antiderivative of $2x$ is $x^2$, since $(x^2)’ = 2x$. Remember to add the constant of integration $+C$ for indefinite integrals. Practice by asking “What differentiates to…?” for simple forms: e.g. $\int 3x^2 dx = x^3 + C$ (since $(x^3)’=3x^2$). This is essentially reversing differentiation rules.
	•	Basic Integration Rules:
	•	Power Rule (Integral form): $\displaystyle \int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$ for $n \neq -1$. (E.g. $\int x^4 dx = \frac{x^5}{5}+C$.) This is the inverse of the power rule for derivatives.
	•	$\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C$. (The one case power rule didn’t cover, since n=-1 case leads to log.)
	•	Exponential/Log integrals: $\int e^x dx = e^x + C$. $\int a^x dx = \frac{a^x}{\ln a} + C$ (for $a>0$). $\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx = \arctan x + C$. $\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx = \arcsin x + C$. It’s okay if inverse trig integrals aren’t memorized yet, but know they exist.
	•	Trig integrals: $\int \sin x dx = -\cos x + C$ (since derivative of cos is -sin, so derivative of -cos is sin). $\int \cos x dx = \sin x + C$. $\int \sec^2 x dx = \tan x + C$ (because $(\tan x)’ = \sec^2 x$). Also $\int \csc^2 x dx = -\cot x + C$. These should be memorized. Others like $\int \sec x \tan x dx = \sec x + C$ are good to know, but less critical than the primary ones.
	•	Linearity: $\int [af(x) + bg(x)] dx = a\int f(x)dx + b\int g(x)dx$. So you can integrate term by term.
	•	Reverse Chain (Substitution) intuition: Recognize simple $u$-substitution scenarios: If an integrand looks like something and its derivative, you can set $u$ to the inner function. Example: $\int 2x(1+x^2)^3 dx$. Notice derivative of $(1+x^2)$ is $2x$. So $u = 1+x^2$ yields $du = 2x dx$, and the integral becomes $\int u^3 du = u^4/4 + C = (1+x^2)^4/4 + C$. This is a preview of a key Calc II integration skill (formal $u$-substitution), but even now start spotting these patterns. Another example: $\int \cos(3x)dx$. We know derivative of $\sin(3x)$ is $3\cos(3x)$, so $\int \cos(3x)dx = \frac{1}{3}\sin(3x)+C$. Generally, if $\int f’(g(x))g’(x) dx$, the answer is $f(g(x)) + C$. (This is just chain rule in reverse.) Practice identifying these because a huge part of Calc II is integrating functions, often by undoing the chain rule.
	•	Definite Integrals and Area: Understand that $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ (the definite integral from a to b) represents the net area under $f(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ (area above the x-axis counts positive, below counts negative). If $f(x) \ge 0$ on [a,b], it’s just the area under the curve. Know the connection: a definite integral can be computed using an antiderivative and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: $\int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)$, where $F’(x) = f(x)$ ￼. This is the crux of FTC Part 2 – it allows you to evaluate areas quickly if you can find an antiderivative.
	•	For example, $\int_0^2 (3x^2) dx$. An antiderivative is $x^3$. So plug 2 and 0: $2^3 - 0^3 = 8$. (Which geometrically would be area under $3x^2$ from 0 to 2.)
	•	If you have a graph or known geometry, you can also compute some integrals by area formulas (like area of a triangle, etc.), but generally we use antiderivatives.
	•	Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (conceptual): Connect differentiation and integration. FTC Part 1 states that $\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)dt = f(x)$ – in other words, the derivative of an area-so-far function returns you to the original integrand function. FTC Part 2 is the evaluation theorem mentioned above. In essence, differentiation and integration are opposites ￼. Make sure you internalize this: it’s why we can solve integrals by finding antiderivatives (which are just derivatives in reverse).
	•	Basic Integral Applications:
	•	Interpretation: If $v(t)$ is velocity, $\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t)dt$ gives displacement (area under velocity curve). If $f’(x)$ is a known rate, $\int f’(x)dx = f(x) + C$ recovers the original quantity (plus constant). Realize that sums (integrals) accumulate change, whereas derivatives measure instantaneous change ￼.
	•	Area calculation: Try a simple one – find the area between $y=x$ and the x-axis from $x=0$ to $x=3$. That’s $\int_0^3 x dx = [x^2/2]_0^3 = 9/2$. If a function dips below the axis, realize the integral counts signed area; you could split the interval or take absolute values if you want total area.
	•	Learning Resources:
	•	Khan Academy – Integration intro: Go through the videos on “Antiderivatives and indefinite integrals” and “Definite integrals & signed area”. Khan will introduce integration as reverse differentiation and show some examples. Then the section on “Fundamental Theorem of Calculus” ties it together. Also try the exercises on basic integration to test your skill at finding antiderivatives.
	•	Paul’s Online Math Notes – Calculus I: Integrals: Paul covers basic integration techniques including substitution. Look at his “Indefinite Integrals” section to see lists of integrals (like a table of common antiderivatives) ￼. Use his examples to practice tricky ones. He also explains the FTC clearly – reading that explanation can reinforce your understanding of why $F(b)-F(a)$ works ￼. If you have time, also glance at any section on substitution (often a part of Calc I or early Calc II notes).
	•	Reference Tables: It might be helpful to have a table of integrals (there are many online). Having a quick reference for trig integrals or others is useful as you practice – over time you’ll memorize them, but initially you can refer to it. OpenStax Calculus or a similar source often has such tables in an appendix.
	•	Practice:
	•	Antiderivatives: For each derivative rule, do a reverse:
	•	Given $f’(x) = 7x^6$, find $f(x)$ (antiderivative $\frac{7}{7}x^7 = x^7 + C$).
	•	$\frac{d}{dx}[\something] = \sec^2 x$, then that something was $\tan x + C$ (since $(\tan x)’ = \sec^2 x$). So $\int \sec^2 x dx = \tan x + C$.
	•	Practice 10 indefinite integrals:
	1.	$\int (5x^4 - 2x + 3) dx$ (polynomial term-by-term).
	2.	$\int \frac{1}{x^3} dx$ (rewrite $x^{-3}$, then power rule -> $-1/(2x^2)+C$).
	3.	$\int \sin x dx$ (answer $- \cos x + C$).
	4.	$\int \sec^2 x dx$ ($\tan x + C$).
	5.	$\int e^{5x} dx$ ($\frac{1}{5}e^{5x}+C$).
	6.	$\int \frac{1}{2x} dx$ ($\frac{1}{2}\ln|x|+C$).
	7.	$\int (3x+2)^5 dx$ (use mental substitution: guess result $\frac{(3x+2)^6}{18}+C$ because derivative of $(3x+2)^6$ brings a factor 18, so you divide by 18). Test by differentiating your result.
	8.	$\int \frac{\cos 3x}{5} dx$ ($= \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{3}\sin 3x + C = \frac{\sin 3x}{15}+C$).
	9.	$\int \frac{2x}{x^2+1} dx$ (recognize $\frac{d}{dx}(x^2+1)=2x$, so this is $\ln|x^2+1|+C$).
	10.	$\int (\sec x \tan x) dx$ ($=\sec x + C$).
	•	Check a few by differentiating your answer to see if you get back the integrand.
	•	Definite integrals: Compute a few with easy antiderivatives:
	•	$\int_1^4 3x^2 dx = [x^3]_1^4 = 64 - 1 = 63$.
	•	$\int_0^{\pi} \sin x dx = [-\cos x]_0^{\pi} = (-\cos \pi) - (-\cos 0) = -(-1) - (-(1)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.
	•	$\int_{-1}^{1} 5x^3 dx = [5x^4/4]_{-1}^{1} = \frac{5}{4}(1^4 - (-1)^4) = \frac{5}{4}(1-1)=0$. (Illustrates an odd function integrated symmetrically gives 0 area – cancellations of positive/negative.)
	•	$\int_0^2 (x^2 - 4) dx$. First, note $x^2-4$ is negative on part of [0,2]. Compute: $[\frac{x^3}{3} - 4x]_0^2 = (\frac{8}{3}-8) - (0-0) = \frac{8-24}{3} = -\frac{16}{3}$. This means net area is -16/3 (the area below outweighed above; if asked for total area you’d take absolute of the negative part separately).
	•	FTC understanding: Take the derivative of an integral function: e.g. define $F(x) = \int_0^x \cos t dt$. By FTC, $F’(x) = \cos x$ (the integrand evaluated at x). Try another: $G(x) = \int_2^{x^2} \sqrt{1+t^2} dt$. Here the upper limit is $x^2$ (a function of x). By the chain rule version of FTC: $G’(x) = \sqrt{1+(x^2)^2} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = \sqrt{1+x^4} \cdot 2x$. This is an advanced example of FTC Part 1 + chain rule (if it’s confusing, skip, but it demonstrates the power of understanding these concepts).
	•	Review and Wrap up: Reflect on what we’ve covered. At this point, you should recognize that integration and differentiation are inverse processes ￼. Summaries might help: Perhaps create a one-page sheet listing all derivative and integral formulas you know, and the main concepts (limit definition, FTC, etc.). This sheet will be a handy reference as you continue to Calculus II.

Why this matters: Integration is the focus of Calculus II. You will learn many techniques (integration by parts, trig integrals, partial fractions, improper integrals) – all of which build on the basics you covered today. Knowing how to find antiderivatives of common functions is crucial; it’s assumed knowledge going into Calc II that you can integrate polynomial, trig, exponential, and basic rational functions. We also saw the Fundamental Theorem, which is the bridge linking the beautiful theory of calculus to practical computation ￼. In Calc II, you will use the FTC to evaluate definite integrals (sometimes in pieces or limits), and to understand properties of functions (for example, using integrals to define new functions like the logarithm or inverse trig). Also, series (a big Calc II topic) can be understood as integrals of power series or as solving differential equations by integration. Thus, having integration fundamentals down – including the recognition that derivatives and integrals are opposites ￼ – will allow you to tackle those advanced topics with confidence.
