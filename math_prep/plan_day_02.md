## Day 2: Basic Algebra – Solving Simple Equations and Rearranging Expressions

**Focus:**  
Lay the algebraic groundwork. Calculus will require you to solve equations for different variables and simplify expressions frequently. Today you’ll master linear equations (your first step into algebra) and foundational algebraic skills.

---

### Topics to Master

- **Combining Like Terms:**  
  Simplify expressions such as  
  \[
  5x + 3 - 2x + 8
  \]  
  by merging like terms (here, \(5x - 2x\) and \(3 + 8\)). This is critical before solving equations.

- **The Distributive Property:**  
  Practice expanding expressions (e.g. \(3(a + 4) = 3a + 12\)) and factoring simple expressions (pulling out common factors).

- **Linear Equations (one variable):**  
  Solve equations of the form \(ax + b = c\).  
  - Start with simple one-step equations (e.g. \(x + 7 = 12\))  
  - Move to two-step equations (e.g. \(3x - 5 = 10\))  
  - Then multi-step equations involving parentheses or fractions, such as:  
    \[
    4(y - 2) = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{2}{3}m + 1 = 5
    \]  
  Ensure you understand that the goal is always to **isolate the variable**.

- **Basic Equation Word Problems:**  
  Set up and solve simple real-life linear equations.  
  Example:  
  > “If 5 added to twice a number is 17, what is the number?”  
  translates to  
  \[
  2x + 5 = 17
  \]  
  This builds comfort in translating words into equations.

- **Intro to Inequalities (Optional if time permits):**  
  Solve basic inequalities (e.g. \(2x + 3 > 7\)) and graph their solution on a number line.  
  While not heavily used in early calculus, inequalities are useful for domain/range discussions and limit definitions.

### Learning Resources

- **Khan Academy – Intro to Algebra:**  
  Go through the *Solving basic equations* module. It covers one-step and two-step equations thoroughly, with videos and plenty of practice problems.  
  Also try *solving equations with variables on both sides* for a challenge (e.g. \(2x + 3 = x - 5\)).

- **Purplemath – Solving Linear Equations:**  
  Read Purplemath’s lesson on solving linear equations. It provides a step-by-step approach and highlights common mistakes (like forgetting to distribute a negative sign).

- **Interactive Practice:**  
  Use an online equation solver such as *School Yourself Algebra*. It offers interactive tutorials where you can practice combining like terms and solving equations step by step.

### Practice

Solve at least **10–15 linear equations** of varying difficulty. For example:

- Simple:  
  \[
  m - 4 = 9 \quad (\text{solution } m = 13)
  \]

- With distribution:  
  \[
  5(2 + t) = 20
  \]

- With fractions:  
  \[
  \frac{z}{3} + 2 = 6
  \]

- Variables on both sides:  
  \[
  4p + 1 = 2p - 5
  \]

Check your answers, and if you get any wrong, rework the steps to find the mistake. Remember: the ability to solve equations reliably is vital for later math classes (like calculus), so get comfortable with the process now.

### Why This Matters

In calculus problems you’ll often need to solve for when two expressions are equal (e.g. finding when velocities match, solving for critical points by setting a derivative to zero, etc.). If you have solid algebraic solving ability, you won’t be derailed by the equation-solving part of a calculus problem. Today’s practice ensures you can isolate variables and simplify expressions confidently, which will make advanced topics much easier to digest.
