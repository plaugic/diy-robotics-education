## ✅ Day 2 Mastery Criteria

You are finished with **Day 2** when:
- You combine like terms without thinking
- Distribution and factoring feel reversible
- Linear equations feel mechanical
- Fractional coefficients do not slow you down
- Inequalities feel like equations with one extra rule
- Word problems no longer feel “wordy”

If any step feels slow or uncertain, repeat that section before advancing.
