Day 2: Basic Algebra – Solving Simple Equations and Rearranging Expressions

Focus: Lay the algebraic groundwork. Calculus will require you to solve equations for different variables and simplify expressions frequently. Today you’ll master linear equations (your first step into algebra) and foundational algebraic skills.
	•	Topics to Master:
	•	Combining Like Terms: Simplify expressions such as $5x + 3 - 2x + 8$ by merging like terms (here, $5x - 2x$ and $3 + 8$). This is critical before solving equations.
	•	The Distributive Property: Practice expanding expressions (e.g. $3(a + 4) = 3a + 12$) and factoring simple expressions (pulling out common factors).
	•	Linear Equations (one variable): Solve equations of the form $ax + b = c$. Start with simple one-step equations (like $x + 7 = 12$), then two-step equations ($3x - 5 = 10$), and multi-step equations involving parentheses or fractions (e.g. $4(y - 2) = 8$ or $\frac{2}{3}m + 1 = 5$). Ensure you understand the goal is to isolate the variable.
	•	Basic Equation Word Problems: Set up and solve a couple of simple real-life linear equations (for example, “If 5 added to twice a number is 17, what is the number?” translates to $2x + 5 = 17$). This builds comfort in translating problems into equations.
	•	Intro to Inequalities: (Optional if time permits) Solve a few basic inequalities (like $2x + 3 > 7$) and graph their solution on a number line. While not heavily used in basic calculus, understanding inequalities is useful for domain/range discussions and limit definitions.
	•	Learning Resources:
	•	Khan Academy – Intro to Algebra: Go through the “Solving basic equations” module. It covers one-step and two-step equations thoroughly, with videos walking through the process and plenty of practice problems. Ensure you also try “solving equations with variables on both sides” for a challenge (e.g. $2x + 3 = x - 5$).
	•	Purplemath – Solving Linear Equations: Read Purplemath’s lesson on how to solve linear equations￼. It provides a step-by-step approach and common mistakes to avoid (like forgetting to distribute a negative sign).
	•	Interactive Practice: Use an online equation solver like School Yourself Algebra￼ – it has interactive tutorials where you can practice combining like terms and solving equations step by step.
	•	Practice: Solve at least 10–15 linear equations of varying difficulty. For instance:
	•	Simple: $m - 4 = 9$ (solution $m = 13$).
	•	With distribution: $5(2 + t) = 20$.
	•	With fractions: $\frac{z}{3} + 2 = 6$.
	•	Both-sides variables: $4p + 1 = 2p - 5$.
Check your answers, and if you get any wrong, rework the steps to find the mistake. Remember: the ability to solve equations reliably is vital for later math classes (like calculus) ￼, so get comfortable with the process now.

Why this matters: In calculus problems you’ll often need to solve for when two expressions are equal (e.g. finding when velocities match, solving for critical points by setting a derivative to zero, etc.). If you have a solid algebraic solving ability, you won’t be derailed by the equation-solving part of a calculus problem ￼. Today’s practice ensures you can isolate variables and simplify expressions confidently, which will make advanced topics much easier to digest.
