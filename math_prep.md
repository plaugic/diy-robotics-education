# 10-Day Math Self-Study Crash Course: From Basics to Calculus II Readiness

---

## Overview

Preparing for **Calculus II in just 10 days** is an intensive but achievable challenge. This plan focuses on **essential topics only**—arithmetic, algebra, functions, trigonometry, and the core concepts of Calculus I—because a solid grasp of these is crucial before tackling Calculus II. Each day builds upon prior material in a logical progression, ensuring you reinforce foundations as you advance.

By the end of **Day 10**, you should feel confident in:
- Manipulating algebraic expressions  
- Understanding and analyzing functions  
- Using trigonometry fluently  
- Computing limits, derivatives, and basic integrals  

All of these are **non-negotiable prerequisites** for Calculus II.

### How to Use This Plan
- Dedicate **several focused hours each day**.
- Each day includes:
  - **Focus**
  - **Topics to Master**
  - **Learning Resources**
  - **Practice**
  - **Why This Matters**
- Practice is mandatory. Reading or watching alone is insufficient.
- Skim material you truly know—but **do not skip core concepts**.
- If something is shaky, slow down and reinforce before moving on.
