10-Day Math Self-Study Crash Course: From Basics to Calculus II Readiness

Overview

Preparing for Calculus II in just 10 days is an intensive but achievable challenge. This plan focuses on essential topics only – arithmetic, algebra, functions, trigonometry, and the core concepts of Calculus I – because a solid grasp of these is crucial before tackling Calculus II. (In fact, the standard prerequisites for calculus include a firm command of algebra, trigonometry, and logarithms ￼.) Each day builds upon prior material in a logical progression, ensuring you reinforce foundations as you advance. By the end of Day 10, you should feel confident in fundamental skills like manipulating algebraic expressions, understanding functions, and using basic trigonometry – all of which are essential before learning calculus ￼.

How to use this plan: Dedicate several hours each day to learning and practice. The plan outlines Topics to Master and suggests Learning Resources (videos, articles, interactive tools) for each day. Be sure to practice problems for every new concept – solving exercises is key to solidifying your understanding ￼. Skim or skip any content you’re already comfortable with, but do not skip core concepts. (If you find the pace too fast at any point, consider slowing down or supplementing with more practice rather than moving on with shaky understanding.) Now, let’s dive into the day-by-day breakdown.

See Day 5 @math_prep/plan_day_05.md

See Day 9 @math_prep/plan_day_09.md
See Day 10 @math_prep/plan_day_10.md

Finally, remember that practice is key: even after this 10-day sprint, continue to solve problems. Calculus is not a spectator sport; the more you do, the more you internalize. You now have a strong foundation from arithmetic through Calc I. With focus and continued practice, you are well-prepared to succeed in Calculus II. Good luck, and enjoy the journey of higher mathematics!
