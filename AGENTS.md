# Context: Robotics Education Strategy

## User Profile

* **Status:** 33-year-old independent student at San Diego Mesa College.
* **Goal:** Build "Advanced Robotics" (Hardware/Humanoids).
* **Admissions Profile:**
* **Rutgers (2011-2014):** Cumulative GPA ~2.41. (Disqualifies for "Academic Amnesty" which requires <2.0). Contains "Anchor" F grades.
* **Mesa (Current):** 4.0 GPA in STEM.
* **Calculated UC GPA:** ~3.2–3.4 (Weighted down by Rutgers).



## Strategic School Hierarchy

### 1. UC San Diego (The Target)

* **Target Majors (Ranked):**
1. **Computer Engineering** (ECE Dept) – *Best for Hardware/Software mix.*
2. **Electrical Engineering** (Signal Processing/Controls depth).
3. **Computer Science** (If purely software focused).


* **Admissions Strategy:**
* **The "Repeat" Fix:** Retake **CS 101**, **Statistics**, and **History** at Mesa. This legally forces the UC GPA calculator to drop the Rutgers "F" grades.
* **Cross-Enrollment (SB 1914):** Take 1–2 Upper Division courses (e.g., *ECE 171: Linear Control*) at UCSD to prove rigor.
* **Unit Cap Check:**
* **Lower Division Rule:** UCSD caps transfer credit at **70 semester units**. You *cannot* be disqualified for having "too many" Mesa/Rutgers 100-level credits.
* **Upper Division Rule:** You are only disqualified ("Senior Standing") if you have **~60+ semester units** of *Upper Division* (300/400 level) coursework.
* **Status:** **SAFE.** Cross-enrollment (4–8 units) will not push you over this limit.





### 2. Oregon State University (The Specialist)

* **Target Major:** **Robotics Engineering**.
* **Why:** Home to **Agility Robotics** (Humanoids).
* **Admissions:** Safety (~80% Acceptance). Requires only 16 transfer units.
* **Financials:** **WUE** (Western Undergraduate Exchange) pricing (~$22k) + Cheap Rent = Cost-competitive with California.

### 3. San Diego State University (The Local Power)

* **Target Major:** **Mechanical Engineering** (Focus on Mechatronics).
* **Why:** Local feeder for Defense (Shield AI, Northrop).
* **Strategy:** Join/Lead the **Mechatronics Club** (RoboSub Champions).

### 4. The "Shadow Curriculum" (Self-Study)

* **Role:** The "Real" Education. This runs parallel to any degree to ensure industry viability.
* **Core Pillars:**
1. **Math:** Linear Algebra (MIT 18.06), Control Theory.
2. **CS:** Embedded Systems (RTOS), Computer Vision.
3. **Hardware:** PCB Design, FPGA (Verilog).


* **Execution:** Use the **"UCSD Applied Robotics Track"** guide (saved in `diy-robotics-education/README.md`) to cherry-pick syllabi and projects.

## Immediate Action Plan (Spring 2026)

1. **Mesa Coursework:**
* **Math:** Calculus II.
* **Science:** Physics I (Mechanics).
* **Repair:** Retake **History** (Essential for GPA boost) + **CISC 190** (Java).


2. **Rutgers Action:**
* Email Rutgers Office of Academic Services. Do **not** ask for "Amnesty." Ask for the petition for **"Retroactive Withdrawal"** (citing personal hardship from 2014). This is the only way to nuke the F's if Amnesty is off the table.


3. **Applications:**
* **OSU:** Apply by **Feb 1** (Priority).
* **UCSD:** Apply **Nov 2026**.
